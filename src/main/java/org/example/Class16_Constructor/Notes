Constructor:
    Constructor help us build the object of a class easily.
    When we build the object most of the time, it means we are initializing
    the instance variables.
Why should we use constructor:
    1) It's more readable, neat and clean.
    2) It's more secure. By Making the fields 'private'

Rules:
    1) Constructors do not have a return types not even void. If you try to
    give a return type it will become a method
    2) Constructors can only have the same name as class name
    3) Constructors can have parameters like methods.
    4) We can use access modifiers as well with Constructors.
