what is OOps?
    -OOPs stands for object oriented programing.
    -It is just a way of writing code. many techniques to write large
amounts of code.
Why should we lean OOPS?
    1) It helps us reduce the code duplication.
    2) It helps us write dynamic code (same code doing different things)
    (Polymorphism)
    3) It helps us write Modular code. (abstraction)
    4) It helps us write secure code. (encapsulation)
Class:
    A class is a user defined blueprint from which objects are created.
    A class represents objects which have similar properties and
    behaviors. we use these  classes to create things quickly and efficiently.
    It's like a design/blueprint that helps us build objects quickly.
