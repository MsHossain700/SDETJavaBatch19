Super Keyword:
    Super keyword is used to explicitly refer to the instance
    variables from the parent class.
    It is also used to call the constructor from the parent class.

How Inheritance?
    Whenever we use Inheritance, the object of the parent classes are
    created first.
    If we do no create any constructor JAVA creates the default ones
    and it uses these default constructor to create these objects
    however when we create our own constructors then JAVA is not
    going to do this for us, and we have to do this ourselves.

Method Overloading:
    Method Overloading allows us to have multiple methods with same
    name inside a class
Why should we overload:
    It gives more flexibility to users. Users don't need to memorize
    lots method names.
    Examples in Calculator and CalculatorTester class
