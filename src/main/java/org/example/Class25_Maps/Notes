Maps:
    Maps allow us to store two things at a time. One is called the
    key and the other is called the value.
    There are three main types of maps:
        1) HashMap
        2) LinkedHashMap
        3) TreeMap

HashMap:
    Upside:
        It's fast.
    Downside:
        It does not remember the insertion order.

LinkedHashMap:
    Upside:
        it remembers the order.
    Downside:
        It's a little slower than the HashMap.

TreeMap:
    Upside:
        It keeps data sorted.
    Downside:
        Insertion is very, very slow.
