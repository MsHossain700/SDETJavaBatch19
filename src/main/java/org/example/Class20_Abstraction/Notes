Abstraction:
    Abstraction allows us to pay attention to the functionality
    instead of implementation details

Why should we use Abstraction?
    1) We can make sure that everybody is on the same page.
    2) We can focus only on those parts which we are supposed to do
    and let others worry about the rest.


Interview Questions:

Can we create the object of the abstract class:
    No it is not allowed as we might have some unimplemented
    methods in abstract in abstract classes.

Can we have instance variables in the abstract class?
    Yes we can because there might be child classes that might
    want to use them.

Can we have final keyword in abstract class:
    No because these two keywords have conflicting purposes and
    functionalities.

Can we make abstract class private:
    No, you cannot declare an abstract class as private because
    subclass/child class

Can we make abstract class protected:
    Yes, because child classes can still access it.
    Default and public access modifiers are permitted too.

Can we have static methods in abstract classes:
    Yes. We can call them directly by their name.
