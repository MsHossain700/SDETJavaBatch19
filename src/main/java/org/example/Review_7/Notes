Methods:
    Are blocks of code which have names, and they contain java code. We
    can call these methods to execute all the code inside them.

Why should we use Methods:
    They help us avoid code duplication in multiple classes. If we need to
    run a piece of code again and again in multiple classes, we can simply
    create a method and can reuse it in all the classes.

Types of Methods:
    Static Method
    Instance Method

Static Method:
    We call these methods by just writing the name of the class. They
    cannot use instance variables.

Instance Method:
    Require us to create an object of class.

Interview Question:
    Can we use instance variables in static methods?
        No, we cannot because instance variables must be initialized
        first before we can start using them.
        Instance variables belong to object and static belongs
        to class.
