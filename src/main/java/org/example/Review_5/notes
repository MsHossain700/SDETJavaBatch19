Nested Loop:
    Nested Loop is a loop inside another loop.
    We can nest any loop inside any other loop
Why should we learn about Nested loop?
    Wee need nested loops to go through multiple level of data for
    example, we might want to go through the main categories of items,
    and we might want to go through individual items in each list.
    We also need Nested loops to process data which have multiple levels
    like a 2D array or an Excel sheet
2D Array:
    2D array is basically a collection of multiple 1D arrays
Why should we lean about 2D arrays:
    when we want to process the information which is present in both
    rows and columns
OOPS:
    Object Oriented Programing
    It is just a way of writing code. many techniques to write large
    amounts of code.
Why should we lean OOPS?
    It helps us write large amounts of code easily
    1) It helps us reduce the code duplication.
    2) It helps us write dynamic code (same code doing different things)
    (Polymorphism)
    3) It helps us write Modular code. (abstraction)
    4) It helps us write secure code. (encapsulation)
Class:
    A Class represents a group of entities with similar attributes and
    behaviors.
