Types of variables:
    In Java there are three types of variables.
    1)Local
    2)Instance
    3)Static/Class variables

Local Variables:
    Those variables which are created inside a block of code are called local
    variables. For example all the variables that we create inside loops, if
    else statements, methods, switch statements they are all called local
    variables.
Upside:
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.
Downside:
    They can only be accessed inside the block of code where they are created.
When to use local variables:
    Always try to use local variables.

Instance Variables:
    The variables which are created outside of block of code but inside a
    class are called Instance variables.
Upside:
    These variables can be used anywhere inside the class.
Downside:
    They keep on occupying the memory even if you are done using them.
When should we use instanced variables:
    1)When we want to share a variable with all of the instance methods of
    a class.
    2)When you are planning to crate multiple objects of a class and you know
    that every object is going to have  a different value then you can also
    use instance variables.

Static/Class Variables:
    Static Variables have the word "Static" key word before them.
Upside:
    Highest visibility.
    Can accessed inside the class in any block of code.
    Can be accessed in static or no-static methods.
    Can be accessed outside of class if coupled with a proper access modifier.
Downside:
    They occupy the memory fore the longest.
When should we use static variables:
    When we want to share something with all the objects or the information
    that stays the same for all the objects, we should store it in static
    variables.
