Exception:
    1) These are types of errors that we face while programing they
    happen run time when computer can't do a task because we are
    asking the computer to do something that is not possible, or it
    does not have the resources.
    2) It's an unwanted event that happens at runtime. It disrupts
    the normal flow of the programs.

Why:
    These types of issues are very expensive to fix,

How to Fix/Avoid Exceptions:
    We can Avoid these Exceptions by using the Try and Catch block

Types of Exceptions:
    Exception has two main types:
        Checked and Non-Checked.
            Checked Exception:
                These important exceptions which must be handled with
                Try Catch blocks. JAVA is going to give us error if
                we don't.
            Non-Checked:
                These are not very important. They can be avoided
                without try catch block.
