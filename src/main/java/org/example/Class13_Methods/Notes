Methods is JAVA
    Methods are block of code that do something when we call them.
    They can take input (arguments/parameters) and they can also
    return data back.

Why should we use methods:
    Method help us save code repetition in multiple classes.

Syntax of Method:
    return type (void,String,Boolean) nameOfMethod(Parameters){
    }

Example:

    void add (int a , int b){
    System.out.println(a + b);
    }
