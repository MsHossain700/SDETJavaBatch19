List:
    1) Insertion order is maintained.

    Upside: Very fast when accessing the elements.
    Downside: Really slow when we have to add or remove data from the
    ArrayList

    list.
    Downside: Very slow when accessing the elements.

        It's fast.
    Downside:
        It does not remember the insertion order.

        it remembers the order.
    Downside:
        It's a little slower than the HashSet.

    Downside:
        Insertion is very, very slow.
